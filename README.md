# Blackbox
Blackbox is an open source CoreXY tool-changing 3D Printer. Originally designed and open-sourced by Marc Schömann

Blackbox is a tool changing 3D Printer originally designed by Marc Schöemann in 2016 to overcome the issue on properly integrating flexible materials with rigid materials for the production of flexible robotic appendages. The current revision of Blackbox was released as an open source project in 2017 and today we are happy to bring you the first of the Blackbox Family of tool changers - Blackbox CE (Community Edition). CE aims to accelerate the project through community participation and engagement via an accessible BOM and ease-of-assembly refinements.

# Is there a kit available for parts? 

Yes - Blackbox is supported by KB3D! Parts are available individually or as comprehensive kits. We continue to work with LDO Motors , Mandala Rose Works , and other trusted community vendors to expand your options.
 

# This machine looks intimidating, can I build one? 

Yes, but maybe. Blackbox has some new (to most) design elements that will push you to learn about systems you may not have dealt with before. In general though, the recommendations from other DIY printer build communities translate well. Those are typically as follows:

This probably shouldn’t be your first 3D printer. There are always exceptions, but the experience you have will likely lean on your previously acquired skills from using and maintaining other machines. 
Despite our best efforts to guide you along, every machine will be different. From the quality of the printed parts to the nuances of your particular configuration. You should be comfortable with the fact that your attention to detail and where-with-all will determine the final product.
You will learn a ton, and probably pick up some new tools to make your life easier. Learning takes time, and so will your build. This is not an 8 hour build!

# Can I contribute, and how?
 
Absolutely! We encourage everyone to give back to the project however possible. Here are some ideas:

Sharing of modifications made to your machine that you think improve the experience or broaden the use case 
CAD optimization and contribution 
Bug fixes, error reporting, and feedback/suggestions 
Documentation refinement
Help your peers where possible 
Purchasing parts through our official store at KB3D.
